# Fake-or-True-News-detection-Project
This project focuses on detecting fake news using machine learning techniques like Random Forest and NLP methods. It processes news content through text preprocessing, feature extraction (TF-IDF, Word2Vec), and model evaluation (accuracy, precision). The system classifies news as real or fake, promoting reliable information.
